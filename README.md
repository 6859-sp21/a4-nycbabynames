### Data


### Design Decisions

A rationale for your design decisions. How did you choose your particular visual encodings, interaction, and animation techniques? What alternatives did you consider and how did you arrive at your ultimate choices?

**Page Layout:** We wanted our visualization to be very clean and concise, and thought that a single page layout best served our purposes. We wanted to include a sidebar to orient our audience to the data, and provide them some information on the data and what interactions are available. We contained all filters/toggles to the sidebar to leave the space for the visualization free of distractions. We also added a label in the top left corner of the visualization window so users don't have to re-look at the current set of toggles to know what they're looking at. It reduces the distance your eyes have to move to gather this information which we think allows our user to gain more from the visualization in a faster way. Similarly, we allowed our visualization window to be draggable and zoomable to give our user the full data exploration experience and the ability to zoom in and see the changes on smaller bubbles of names (the less common names), and a non-distracting reset button to reorient them to the bubble visualization in case they dragged or zoomed too far. 

**Bubbles:**

**Tooltips:**

**Search View:** Naturally, we felt that people's first inclination is always "what's in it for them?". People always want to be able to relate to the data, and as such, we gave users the ability to search their name in the whole NYC dataset (note that in the regular visualization view, we only show the top 100 names).
